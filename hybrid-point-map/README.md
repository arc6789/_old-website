HYBRID POINT MAP Project (Work in progress)

This project was inspired by some of the projects I had worked on during a previous internship 
at a company that makes software for location and tracking. Hybrid Point Map  
is a web application that is a work in progress using Google Maps API. 


Google Maps API key (for JavaScript) is required for this project.

Link to acquire key (Google account required): https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial

Replace new key with old key found in index.html on line 11.
